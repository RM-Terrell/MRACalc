# MRACalc
First ever website from early 2016. Built this for MedAware Systems Inc as a way to offload some every day math that the data analysts did on a day to day basis. When I started this project I didnt even know how to link a .css file to an html file. Needless to say it was an adventure.

Contains simple javascript for handling statistical conversions and my first every adventure into jquery for making a dynamic table. Can be ran by downloading all files into the same folder and running the html file.

"First Project" contains code for my first attempt at using the Electron Framework, recycling and eventually diverging the original MRACalc webpage into its own desktop app with added functionality granted by file system manipulation.
